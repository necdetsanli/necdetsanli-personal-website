              Do Not Ghost Me – Anonymous Recruitment Ghosting Tracker
            </div>

            <p class="tiny">
              Do Not Ghost Me is an open-source, privacy-first platform that
              collects anonymous reports about recruitment ghosting and
              aggregates them into company-level statistics. The goal is to give
              candidates more transparency about how companies behave during
              hiring processes and to encourage more respectful communication
              practices.
            </p>

            <ul class="list">
              <li>
                Designed and implemented a full-stack web application using
                Next.js (App Router) and TypeScript, with a PostgreSQL database
                accessed via Prisma.
              </li>
              <li>
                Built an anonymous reporting flow with structured fields (stage,
                seniority, role category, country, days without reply) and a
                public “Top companies” page that ranks companies by ghosting
                reports with rich filtering.
              </li>
              <li>
                Implemented a hardened API layer with strict Zod validation,
                CSRF protection, salted IP hashing, honeypot fields, and per-IP
                / per-company rate limiting to prevent abuse while avoiding
                storage of raw IP addresses.
              </li>
              <li>
                Developed an admin dashboard for moderating reports (flagging,
                soft delete, hard delete) while keeping public statistics based
                only on active, non-deleted entries.
              </li>
              <li>
                Set up a devcontainer-based local environment (Docker +
                PostgreSQL) and reproducible scripts for database setup,
                migrations, and realistic dummy data seeding.
              </li>
              <li>
                Added a comprehensive testing setup with Vitest (unit &
                integration tests) and Playwright (end-to-end tests), plus
                linting, type-checking and CI-friendly verification scripts.
              </li>
              <li>
                Documented the system with a detailed README, PRIVACY and
                CONTRIBUTING guidelines, and JSDoc-based internal documentation
                for core library modules.

              EyeRest – Windows Tray App for the 20–20–20 Rule
            </div>

            <p class="tiny">
              EyeRest is a lightweight Windows tray application that helps users
              follow the 20–20–20 rule for eye health (every 20 minutes, look at
              something 20 feet away for 20 seconds). It runs quietly in the
              notification area and shows periodic desktop notifications so
              regular eye breaks become a natural part of screen-heavy workdays.

            <p class="tiny">
              Developed an image-processing pipeline that detects and reads
              expiration dates from product images and stores the results in a

              noise reduction, contrast enhancement) to make date regions more
              readable, then applied OCR to extract the expiration date text.
              Designed basic validation logic to filter out invalid or ambiguous
              dates and linked each extracted date to the corresponding product
              record for later querying and analysis.

              </li>
              <li>
                Implemented OCR-based date extraction and parsing to standardize

              <li>
                Added validation and error-handling logic to detect invalid
